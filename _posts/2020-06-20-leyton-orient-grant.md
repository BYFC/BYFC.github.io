title: "Leyton Orient Fans Trust grant"
---

Leyton Orient Fans Trust (LOFT) has very kindly provided Barming Youth FC with a Â£200 grant to support our three new Under 7 teams in the 2020/21 season. 

This grant will go towards buying equipment and kit for the team. 

LOFT was created in 2001 to provide an independent supporters' organisation that could articulate the views of Orient supporters, lobby the club and provide the basis for some element of fan ownership of the football club. You can find out more about LOFT [here](http://www.leytonorientfanstrust.com/about.asp).
