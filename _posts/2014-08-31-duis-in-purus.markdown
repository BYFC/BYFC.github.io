We have set up an easy fund raising account that will raise money for the club by simply buying things online. 

For example, if you want to buy something from Amazon, or Asda or John Lewis or one of a number of different companies, instead of going directly to their websites go via the link below. You will have to sign up for an account with Easy Fund Raising (it won't cost you anything) and then go via their website to the online store you want to buy from. Then when you buying something the club will get a small amount of money (again, it won't cost you anything).
Please give it a go the next time you buy online:
