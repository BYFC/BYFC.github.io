title: "FA charter standard renewed for 2018/19"
---

We are very pleased to announce that we have passed the FA "health check" and have been awarded Charter Standard status for 2018/19. 

After a lot of work by various members of the club (you know who you are!) we have passed the FA health check and have been awarded Charter Standard status for 2018/19. This is important because it demonstrates that Barming Youth FC meets rigorous standards shows our dedication towards raising standards, implementing respect and prioritising safe and well organised opportunities for all.

Thank you to everyone involved, including all of the coaches and managers who did their level 1 training, first aid and safe-guarding. Also a huge thanks to the officers in the club who managed and supported this process.
