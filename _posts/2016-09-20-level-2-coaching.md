title: "Do you fancy level 2 coaching?"
---


We are keen to expand our existing network of qualified coaches and are looking to support more coaches to undertake level 2 qualification.

The club will enter into a contract with relevant coaches to cover the cost of the qualification fee in return for provision of coaching within the club. This is a great opportunity for those seeking to extend their coaching knowledge and a useful accredited skill. 

If you are interested, please send a quick email to Simon Kiefer [update 2017-07-31: please now contact [Anna Fleming](mailto:annafleming47@gmail.com)] direct who will contact you to go through the specific details.
