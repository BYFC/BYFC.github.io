New investment from The FA helps to secure long-term future of Barming Youth FC 

* Barming Youth FC awarded £750 Stay in the Game grant
* Investment will boost the retention of adult male footballers

Barming Youth FC has been awarded a grant from The FA's Stay in the Game scheme to help aid the club's retention of its adult male players, giving them the financial support to cover the costs incurred by grassroots clubs.

The Stay in the Game scheme is funded by The FA and delivered by the Football Foundation, with grants of £750 awarded to existing clubs in order to boost financial sustainability and allow clubs to continue offering playing opportunities in organised football.

The grants can be used towards matchday and training facility hire and league affiliation costs as well as covering match day subs for individuals that aren’t able to afford their regular match fees.

Warren Lindley club Chairman, said: [“Insert quote with reference to the Football Foundation.”]


Stay in the Game is inclusive of players from different ethnic backgrounds, faiths and sexual orientations.  

This push to sustain adult male teams follows the recent Grow the Game funding scheme for 2019, which made £1.5 million available for grassroots clubs looking to create new women and girls or disability football teams. 

As well as Grow the Game, the Football Foundation uses investment from the Premier League, The FA and the Government, through Sport England, to provide enhanced sporting facilities across the country. Since 2000, the Foundation has supported over 16,500 grassroots projects worth more than £1.5bn.
