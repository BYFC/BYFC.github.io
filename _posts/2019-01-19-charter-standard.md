title: "FA charter standard renewed for 2019/20"
---
Barming Youth Football Club is delighted to announce that we have recently achieved the FA Charter Standard Award again. The programme is the FA’s accreditation scheme for grassroots clubs and leagues, offering many benefits to those clubs and recognising the achievements within them. 

As a result of the scheme Barming Youth FC will receive a number of advantages. Some of these include official Nike FA match balls, support with funding applications and administration, free England youth and women’s international tickets and much more. 

A statement from the FA website reads ‘FA Charter Standard accreditation is awarded to clubs and leagues rigorously adjudged to be well-run and sustainable&mdash;and which prioritise child protection, quality coaching and implementation of the Respect programme.’ 

To sum up, this will be sure to help the club's already-growing reputation and this outstanding achievement is an incredible start to 2019.
