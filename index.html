					<h2>About Barming Youth FC</h2>
					<img src=/images/BYFC-small.svg width="200"> 
					<p>
Barming Youth FC was founded in 1980 with just one team. The club has grown extensively since then, adding many teams including girls, ladies, men's and veterans teams. The aim of the club is to provide all local youth opportunities to play football regardless of their abilities. The club has become an FA Charter Standard club. The Charter Standard Scheme is a best practice guide that sets standards of coaching, administration and child protection for clubs working with young people. As a benchmark for quality, it will improve the playing experience for all.
