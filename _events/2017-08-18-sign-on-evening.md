The third and final registration evening will be held at the Duke of Edinburgh pub on Friday 18 August from 8 pm.

Please remember to bring along the registion forms and completed subs payment sheet, and the initial payment. 
It would be helpful if BACS payments could be recorded on a separate sheet.
