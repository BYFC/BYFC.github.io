As you are, probably, aware the Government recently announced a further relaxation of the COVID-19 guidelines which concerned training and friendly matches for grass roots sports, including football. The FA has now released updated guidelines which we have built into the the club's risk assessment (see below). The updated guidelines entitled 'The FA&mdash;COVID-19 Guidance on re-starting competitive grassroots football' also covers the latest FA guidance on the safe return to fixtures and tournaments.

The main changes are that, with immediate effect, competitive training can now begin with the overall group size (inclusive of coaches) limited to 30 people. Social distancing is still to be observed during times when the players are not training or playing. Parents/Guardians of primary school-aged children must be present. Contact details of those present at the sessions must be taken in order to provide track and trace details should you be made aware of anyone testing positive or showing symptoms of COVID-19.

In general the rules have not changed a great deal so I and the club want to be clear that this relaxation does not mean that we can now all simply turn up and play a match in the same way as we did before we went into lock down. It is vital that all Managers, Coaches, Players and Parents familiarise them with the guidelines to make it as safe as possible for participants whilst you try and build up fitness in advance of, what we hope, will be a seasons start during September 2020.

If there are any players or parents that do not feel confident enough to return to training yet, or may be shielding a relative please make your manager/coach aware as there is no need for you to return if you don't wish to. Your place in your squad will not be in any danger but you/they may need to catch up with match fitness further down the line.

Please do take the time to read and understand all of the information available and I look forward to seeing you all back on a football pitch, in Barming, sometime very soon.
