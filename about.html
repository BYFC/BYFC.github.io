Barming Youth F.C. was founded in 1980 with just one team. The club has grown extensively since then, adding many teams including girls, ladies, men's and veterans teams. The aim of the club is to provide all local youth opportunities to play football regardless of their abilities. The club has become an F.A. Charter Standard club. The Charter Standard Scheme is a best practice guide that sets standards of coaching, administration and child protection for clubs working with young people. As a benchmark for quality, it will improve the playing experience for all.

Barming Youth will be running over 30 teams this season from Under 5s up to Seniors, including three girls sides, and these teams will be playing at Barming School, South Street, Barming Heath, Poplar Grove, Mereworth, Gatland Lane, Eccles and West Malling. The season starts early September for all of the Barming teams and runs through to late March. Once the season is over, most teams take part in various tournaments around the county, in particular our own tournament.
