<h3>A) OBJECTIVE</h3>

To support the overall objectives of BYFC by positively promoting:

<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span> Competitive and non-competitive, football activities.</li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>The development of youth with emphasis on the teaching of skills.</li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>The teaching of teamwork and the enhancement of an overall attitude of good sportsmanship.</li>
</ul>

This Code of Conduct is established to accomplish these purposes.

<h3>B) RESPONSIBILITY OF PARTICIPANTS</h3>

The objectives can best be achieved through the concentrated effort of all individuals who participate in the activities of BYFC. The benefit to the youth will depend to a large degree on the attitude created by the club, coaches, players, spectators & referees. 

The following is a list of examples of unacceptable behaviour. Participants may be subject to discipline under this policy if they: 

<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>Intentionally injure or attempt to injure another participant. </li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>Verbally or physically abuse another participant. </li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>Endanger or threaten another participant. </li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>Refuse to comply with the request of a club official, coach or referee. </li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>Refuse to comply with the policies and rules of BYFC. </li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>Behaviour in conflict with the clubs diversity and equity policy. </li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>Failure to demonstrate respect for fellow players, opposing players, match officials and the good name of the club and the game of football. </li>
</ul>

Therefore, each participant (coach, parent, referee, spectators and players) hereby agrees to assume the following responsibilities as a condition of participating in BYFC activities.

<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>All participants assume a general responsibility that all of their actions will be consistent with the goals and objectives (listed below) of the BYFC. Fair play and good sportsmanship is required of all participants. </li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>Coaches and referees will be responsible for the fair enforcement of all applicable Football rules, including but not limited to those involving the use of eligible players, minimum-playing requirements and sportsmanlike conduct. </li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>Coaches, referees, committee members and spectators should serve as appropriate role models for our children. </li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>In addition to the personal responsibilities of all spectators under this code to act in a mature and sportsmanlike manner, all sections will be responsible to control spectators and enforce these rules as they apply to spectators for their respective teams. </li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>Actions of violation of these standards should be reported immediately to your team coach or to any committee member. </li>
</ul>

<h3>C) PROCEDURE FOR VIOLATIONS</h3>

<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>Violations of this code may subject participants to disciplinary action including written Warning, suspension from BYFC activities, or of expulsion depending on the severity of the violation. </li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>All violations of this code shall be immediately reported to the appropriate Team Coach and or the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the club, who may ask for written Reports of the incident from those having knowledge of the occurrence. </li> 
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>The Chairman or Vice Chairman will investigate the matter fully and report to the Committee. </li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>The Committee will consider appropriate disciplinary action as soon as practicable, after receiving the investigation report. </li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>The Committee will provide written conclusions to the individual who is facing discipline and where appropriate offer the individual opportunity to present their position to the Committee.</li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>This notice will advise the individual of the nature of the misconduct and the possible or recommended penalties. If the individual facing discipline is a child, notice will go to the parent / guardian. </li>
<li><span class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></span>BYFC is bound by the rules of the KCFA. </li>
</ul>

We expect the highest standards of behaviour from people representing BYFC. The Code Of Conduct clearly outlines what we expect from every player, parent and club official. 

All parties are asked to sign up to the Code Of Conduct.
